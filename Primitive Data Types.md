# Primitive Data Types

Java has 8 primitive data types:
* `byte` - represents a byte
* `boolean` - "true" or "false" values
* `short` - "short" integers
* `int` - regular integer
* `long` - "long" integer
* `float` - "short" real numbers
* `double` - "long" real numbers
* `char` - single ASCII character

Programmers will mostly use the `boolean`, `int`, `double`, and sometimes the `char` data types, but it is good to know the other primitive data types and the differences between them.

| byte | char | short | int | long | float | double |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 byte | 2 bytes | 2 bytes | 4 bytes | 8 bytes | 4 bytes | 8 bytes |
| `0` | `'a'` | `4` | `148` | `12897498` | `0.94` | `0.5972739` |
