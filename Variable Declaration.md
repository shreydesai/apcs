# Variable Declaration

Variables are used to store information and data in different formats. The general formula is: `<variable type> <variable name> = <variable data>;`

```java
// Declare an integer variable
int x1 = 5;

// Declare a double variable
double x2 = 5.0;

// Declare a boolean variable
boolean x3 = true;
```

Variables can also be declared and then initialized later. This means that the variable's name is stored in the system, but then the contents of the variable is allocated in memory later on.

```java
// Declare the variable
int x1;

// Initialize the variable
x1 = 5;
```
